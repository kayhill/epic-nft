# NFT Collection

This is a Hardhat project, created during a week long course with Buildspace. It represents a simple smart contract that allows users to mint NFTs. It uses the OpenZepplin smart contract library and a Base64 encoding library.

Run.js is used to test the contract in the local environment. Deploy.js deploys the contract to the Rinkeby chain on the Ethereum Test Network. 

I built a React app UI to allow users to interact with the contract and mint NFTs. https://github.com/kayhill/halloween-nft-ui

The contract limits the collection to 50 items. You can view all minted NFTs here: https://testnets.opensea.io/collection/halloweennft-v2
